Welcome to Apache Libcloud's documentation!
===========================================

.. note::
   Libcloud v3.5.0 dropped support for Python 3.5 and now only supports Python
   >= 3.6.

   Libcloud v3.0.0 dropped support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4 and now only
   supports Python >= 3.5.

   If you still need to us Libcloud with one of the now unsupported Python
   versions, you can do that by using an older release of Libcloud which still
   supports that Python version (Libcloud v3.4.x for Python 3.5 and Libcloud
   v2.8.x for Python 2.7 and Python 3.4).

Apache Libcloud is a Python library which hides differences between different
cloud provider APIs and allows you to manage different cloud resources through
a unified and easy to use API.

Resource you can manage with Libcloud are divided in the following categories:

* :doc:`Cloud Servers and Block Storage </compute/index>` - services such as Amazon EC2 and
  Rackspace CloudServers
* :doc:`Cloud Object Storage and CDN </storage/index>` - services such as Amazon S3 and
  Rackspace CloudFiles
* :doc:`Load Balancers as a Service </loadbalancer/index>` - services such as Amazon Elastic Load Balancer
* :doc:`DNS as a Service </dns/index>` - services such as Amazon Route 53 and Zerigo
* :doc:`Container Services </container/index>` - container virtualization like Docker and Rkt as well as container based services
* :doc:`Backup as a Service </backup/index>` - services such as Amazon EBS and OpenStack Freezer
